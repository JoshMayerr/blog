Even though we're dreaming, let's start with a fact. AGI is on its way. All of the largest tech companies are building multi-gigawatt datacenters with their own power plants to train the largest models possible.

If you believe that, there's still one more prerequisite belief. No matter how intelligent a model, it is only as useful and valuable as the tasks it can accomplish. With no outside connection, a model just running locally has very little chance at justifying the billions of dollars being spent to train them. Justifying that money being spent means building revenue generating applications on top of foundation models. Whether or not models are classified as AGI, 2025 seems to be a make or break year to see these applications of AI happen.

This means that applications that use the latest foundation model, aka agents, need to interact with the world and internet. I've been calling this the agentic internet.

The best practice for how to build agents that do this today is still a debate. I've already written about [why browsers are not fundamental to agents](/posts/browsers). It's not about scraping websites or automating UI interactions. It's about creating standardized ways for AI agents to perform real-world tasks. Taking this stance, we need agents to be able to programmatically connect to and interact with existing web services.

Instead of websites being the only frontend of most services on the internet, special APIs will be too. Agent facing APIs could become a secondary frontend that services support. These APIs allow agents to easily do things on the internet as first class citizens.

There are many classic examples of agents connecting to the outside world with simple examples. ChatGPT today is one of them. When a user asks about a realtime topic like the news, it has access to some sort of web search API where it can scrape articles and pull that information into context.

That's obviously a simplified example where the agent only has access to one tool it can make use of. I want to explore a few examples that involve authorization, tool searching, human-in-the-loop, and others that demonstrate what an actually useful agent could look like. An agent that actually works as a part of the agentic internet.
