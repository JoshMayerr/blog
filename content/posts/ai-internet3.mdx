`this is an unfinished draft`

A couple huge things have happened since [part 1] and [part 2]. MCP has completely taken off, Cloudflare annouced a [partnership] with Coinbase, and OpenAI announced ACP in [partnership] with Stripe.

This edition strings together how these advancements relate, and how they are building towards the same Vision of the "Agentic Internet" (i dont like this name anymore) we started describing in [part 1], inspired by the [Programmable Web].

To understand the story connecting everything, it's easiest just to skip right to the end and build up intuition for what the Vision is. In one sentence, the Agentic Internet is an internet where services build for agents as the primary user. A lot of current day efforts are spent basically building agents that act as human users, on top of the (old) internet. I've talked a lot about [why browsers are not fundamental to agents] and why building for agents instead is very likely to happen. What that looks like and what happens when that takes place is more interesting. Which is what I'll get to towards the end of this.

Turning back to the final Vision, the wild adoption of MCP actually supports it being correct. MCP was the first widespread example of important people explicitly building for agents. While only a select few today, it demonstrates that with correct incentives, services will want to optimize how agents interact with them.
