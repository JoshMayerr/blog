- its surprisingly easy to just completely change the trajectory of your life in a single weekend if you really want to. there is nothing stopping you besides people's perception and your calculated opportunity cost
- your body and mind will adapt to whatever new lifestyle, no matter how different it is. hedonic adaptation
- i dont like working on anything without a strong sense of purpose or opportunity
- i enjoy coding
  - not enough to justify blindly doing it everyday to benefit someone else
- there are plenty of people academically smarter than me
- "ceo skill" is almost entirely
  - knowing money in money out
  - talking to people
  - selling to people
  - telling stories
  - being someone that people like
- business skill is not startup skill
  - both are good for startups
    - i can compete with a lot of "idea people"
- i am very lucky to have spent so much time at home this semester
- exercise keeps me mentally sharp
- not a lot of people raise money, but very few raise a priced round
- b2b anything takes insanely long
- being completely alone and working will be fun one day, but it wasn't this semester
- i am not good at working for disproportionate recognition
- id rather to put my full effort into something or not at all
- average software systems are not incredibly complex
  - elite products are -- but not at the start
- speculating about the future of tech and its place in the world is fun
  - especially fun when i feel like i have an underlying understanding of how it works and what is currently possible
- san francisco is the center of everything in tech and it is not close
- no one actually cares
