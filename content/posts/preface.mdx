### What does a 19 year old really have to say? Josh Mayer?

There's really not much of a better answer than: nothing important.

However, I would like to think that maybe at some point in the future someone will enjoy looking back on some of the notes and maybe see something that I didn't.
Just about every tech nerd writes their own blog, and I am certainly no different, but I can't help and be excited enough to talk about what I'm working on right now, and
there's really no reason not to. Things have the potential to get pretty crazy, even in the next week, so I'm hoping to be able to write about at least some of it
and see where it goes.

Moving back on topic of this preface, the point of these notes is to just keep a log of how my _technial journey_ (yuck) progresses. Even if it goes completely
terrible, at least it's something.

If you don't know who I am and you're reading this that's quite unlikely but makes me very happy, my name is Josh Mayer. I am currently in my second year studying
Computer Science and I've been building random projects for a few years now honestly. You can find them on my real website, but the one that contributes to the story arc the most
is my most recent: [sunflowers.dev](sunflowers.dev).

A few weeks ago, we [publically announced](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jooshmayer_super-hyped-to-share-that-my-latest-project-activity-7125333989392822272-psWC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
that it would be aquired by another startup in Boston. In all honesty, this is fairly misleading. Sorry. What actually happened is that
my mentor from an accelerator I was a part of over the summer was impressed with me and Greta's work, so he wanted us to come along as he started his own startup. In return, he offered
to "acquire" sunflowers.

That's the short summary, I probably write a longer note about that entire process.

So, now you have a basic background on who I am at least. I'm not going to try to convince you why you should care and/or read any of this. I don't imagine anyone really will.
I am excited just to write into the empty void with no likes, comments, or any of the inherit eyeballs of social media.

Once again, I really have no clue what these notes will end up like and equally where my life might end up. There is a very, very small chance that this could lead to something
that has brought you here. Who knows and at the end of the day who cares, but if you're here, thank you I hope these notes provide some value.
