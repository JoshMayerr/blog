Up until now, the internet has successfully differentiated humans and bots (at least enough to rely on). But in the age of AI this will not work. Captchas are easily bypassed, and eventually
any user interaction on the internet will probably be navigable by an AI agent. Given this future, why continue to distinguish the two? What were to happen if you opened up the
flood gates to bot mania? Imo, it might actually work to build a newer, more efficient layer of the internet where you dont have to actually navigate page to page. Instead all
a human needs to do is ask for exactly what they want.

When you think about what you do daily on the internet today you probalu think about scrolling on TikTok, X, or checking your email.

Obviously, there are many concerns with such a drastic change to the internet.
