#### To be honest, I don't really know.

Anyone who is not me or Greta would probably read the title of this note
or even my LinkedIn post, which got way too many views for some reason,
and have some type of feelings toward it. I'm not just saying that to be cocky,
like look at who is commenting/liking that post or I can show you some of the texts
I've gotten recently. People at least are reacting.

Whether it might be cringe, annoyed, or maybe jealous I think being on the other side
of things has given me a really interesting prespective on how I've looked up to
"success", especially in tech. To get to that, you have to understand how we ended
up here.

#### Summer 2k23

Under the hood, the real story of how we got acquired starts with this past
summer, where Greta and I spent all of our time at BU's Summer Accelerator.
TLDR, it was pretty hard. Granted we were more than priviledged to have that
opportunity, at least when you make working on a project your entire life,
it create's lots of ups and downs. (1) I woke up everyday and worked until I went to sleep.
At least for 80% of the days in Boston.

What made it most mentally challenging is that we really had no clue what exactly
we wanted to build, and whether it was actually worthwhile. The main lesson there
is that no one knows, not even you. The only failure is not to try.

And so we did. And our mentor for over the summer was really impressed with what we
made. Leading into the fall, when internships start becoming a huge buzzword on college
campuses, we also started to get some real traction. (2)

Once we got back in the fall, here's where you actually might believe me that
the only failure is not to try. So, we had some traction, nothing groundbreaking,
but something. Coincidentally, our mentor decided that he also was starting his own
startup and therefore wanted me to join. In the end, he offered us a job, in return for
acquiring the project.

If we had been to scared to actually finish the project, or rage quit because
we didn't think anyone would have wanted to use it, then none of that would
have happened. Just because of some thoughts I had in my head. Doubting myself.

#### The power of a storyline

Seeing all of these reactions to my end result, when they obiously don't know
what actually happened sort of feels like I'm being a con man. In reality, I know I'm
not. Which leads me to think that this experience really isn't lightyears different
than the typical "success" story you might hear on a podcast or something.

So, in reality this storyline really lets people imagine a lot more than it actually
took or means. And that creates incredible power. But if you read the title or whatnot
and felt some type of way about it, then now you know what I know in that a win is really
just a string of failures one after the other, until one shot on goal leads to something
on the scoreboard.

Not that I've "won" much yet, that's why I'll stay here getting shots up.

_Extra Notes_

1. I've tried to write about that lifestyle vs. more "typical" college, but
   I'll come back for that later. It's quite a philosophical conversation for
   another time.
2. If you're interested, I can give you the secret sauce on how we sort of growth
   hacked that. It ended up being not as hard as you might think to get some initial
   users in the door.
