the free and open web is no longer possible. there will be orders of magnitude more bots on the internet than humans. on this new internet, some of these bots will be bad, trying to scrape content without permission or pretending to be a human they aren't. some will be good, acting on behalf of real humans. how could the internet possibly know who to block and who not to? that's the wrong question. the correct solution is to treat good bots as first-class citizens. block everyone, prove yourself for access. this is imperative for all ads-based businesses. with less human traffic, and more bot traffic ads will become worthless. content publishers and social media are the first to feel this problem. apis too. reddit turning off the api, x making theirs extremely expensive. the final segment to face this are services like uber and airbnb. they are not safe in the long run. both bad bots and good bots want to automate their platforms. bad bots to scrape, and good bots to abstract away the research and checkout process. the problem for uber is that the interface with which users interact is extremely valuable to them. letting browsers agents use stagehand to click buttons autonomously means they cant effectively upsell or convert to subscriptions that they rely on. their response right now is probably to increase their cybersecurity efforts to block all non human users. but as more people use chatgpt agent mode to book their jetblue flights, and as agents get more popular it will be very difficult only let good bots through, with proper access. even if cloudflare successfully has a verified hostname registry of agents, who will decide if my browser agent has authorization to click the "add to cart" button but not the "buy now"? all three categories of internet business share the same fate: your service is either free, or it is open. it cannot be both. if something is free and open, agents will abuse the platform with no meaningful way of building a platform useful for users. something can be free, but gated off to the rest of the internet. or, it can be open, but monetization is the bottleneck that equilibrates usage, and fairly supports the ecosystem. as services trend in this direction, their form factors will similarly change to reflect the new market dynamics. they will all have to look like agent-facing apis. (this is truly what makes mcp interesting, although mcp may not be the protocol that ultimately remains). an agent-facing api treats bots on the internet as first class users. all three internet business categories will transition to an agent-facing api with a usage based pricing model. i predict the pricing will be extremely dynamic and pressure sensitive. nothing like usage based pricing today. these apis will flip the cybersecurity cat and mouse game on its head. any bot is welcome, as long as you pay. in the long run this is favorable for both sides, as the price of scraping continues to increase. why not just have a direct way to access the service instead of a bot pretending to be a human? businesses like instacart may not feel much pressure right now because they aren't entirely open. a phone number is required to make an account. but, a site like reddit spends an incredible amount of money serving pages to crawlers and blocking bad bots. what if they just shut the site down and put up an api for a fair price? so, these agent-facing applications can boil down to a few properties: idk. the most interesting part of how these new internet applications could be built is that by using a standard open protocol, any type of agent will be able to interact with any service. a huge bottleneck of software that build software is authorization and access. stablecoins can solve both monetization and this problem. stablecoins offer a way to programmatically exchange value between the agent's wallet and the service. the "checkout" experience on the internet today is not built for bots. letting a browser agent input credit card details into a stripe webpage is way to brittle. but this experience is prevalent not just in ecommerce, but also in using apis today. using any api requires presumably a human to create an account and buy api credits. this entire flow was built 20 years ago for purchasing real world items. stablecoins are built to support digital transactions. therefore, it is clear that agent facing apis will be accessed using crypto based payments and authorization.
